# Introduction

We are writing a very small cli-helper script for Linux and Mac (we don't need to support Windows).

# Docs 
We keep the docs in the README.md, written in markdown

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write commits in the imperative mood (e.g., `Add zone lookup helper`) and keep the subject under 72 characters. Group related refactors or feature work together; separate formatting-only changes. Pull requests should include: a concise summary of the change, reproduction or verification steps (`go build`, `go test`), and any follow-up work. Link to tracking issues when available and add screenshots or sample CLI output if behavior changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
We write secure code and never store any secrets in code.

# Unclear instuctions
If stuff is unclear always clarify before implementing and planning the change
